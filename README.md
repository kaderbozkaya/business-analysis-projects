# 💰 Financial Management Project  

### I designed a financial management platform focusing on user experience, data visualization, and goal tracking.  
The project includes analysis and design deliverables created using **Figma**, **Miro**, and **UXPressia**.

## 👤 Persona  
I created a **persona** to represent the target user of the financial management platform.  
It helped me understand user goals, pain points, and behaviors related to tracking expenses and savings.

## 👤 Persona 2 – Student  

I created a second **persona** to represent a younger target user with a student profile.  
Elif Alya aims to manage her budget efficiently, reduce unnecessary spending, and improve her financial literacy.  
This persona helped identify user needs around budgeting habits and visual spending insights.

## 🗺️ Site Map  
I designed a **site map** to define the structure of the financial management app.  
It includes main sections like **Dashboard**, **Expenses**, **Reports**, and **Settings** for clear navigation.
