A professional managing e-commerce operations, focused on efficient product management, inventory tracking, and smooth platform workflows.

I created a User Story Map to visualize the main user flows and prioritize features of the Amazon e-commerce experience.
This map helped structure the product backlog and identify core functionalities such as browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.
